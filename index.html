<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>This year I began my first semester at Florida Gulf Coast University as a Software Engineering Major. I've been interested in computers from a very early age but only recently decided to pursue a career in Software Engineering. The only class I am currently taking that is relevant to my major is Intro to Computer Science. It's early in the semester so we haven't done many projects but the assignment we did in Scratch has definitely been my favorite so far. It was my first time ever using Scratch and my project was pretty rough but I enjoyed making it.</p>

<p>This is my first attempt at creating a website and using HTML and CSS outside of Codecademy. It's certainly been a learning experience. I hope to learn a lot more during this semester and put it to use on this website. Thanks for stopping by! </p>
