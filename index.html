<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>This year I began my first semester at Florida Gulf Coast University as a Software Engineering Major. I've been interested in computers from a very early age but only recently decided to pursue a career in Software Engineering. The only class I am currently taking that is relevant to my major is Intro to Computer Science. It's early in the semester so we haven't done many projects but the assignment we did in Scratch has definitely been my favorite so far. It was my first time ever using Scratch and my project was pretty rough but I enjoyed making it.</p>

<p>This is my first attempt at creating a website and using HTML and CSS outside of Codecademy. It's certainly been a learning experience. I hope to learn a lot more during this semester and put it to use on this website. Thanks for stopping by! </p>

  <h1>Usability/Accessability</h1>
  <p>At the top left of the page there's an audio player that plays the Green Hill Zone theme song from the video game Sonic the Hedgehog. Under that is the title of the website to tell you where you are and under that is a canvas element welcoming you to the website. A brief introduction is placed under the canvas element and beneath that is the About Me section. Links are provided for the various projects Iâ€™ve done in my class and a Hobbies section to display my interests. Under the first on the list, Film/Photography a video link shows drone footage at a park in my hometown and is an example of the type of photography/filming I would like to do. After the list of hobbies is a bright blue svg element in the shape of a rectangle with white text in the middle that says Favorite Game and beneath that is a picture of the opening screen of my favorite game, Sonic the Hedgehog. At the bottom of the page is a pdf file of report I wrote on Computer Science. </p>
