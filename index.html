<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ryan Williams, and this year I began my first semester at Florida Gulf Coast University as a Software Engineering Major. I've been interested in computers from a very early age but only recently decided to pursue a career in Software Engineering. The only class I am currently taking that is relevant to my major is Intro to Computer Science. It's early in the semester so we haven't done many projects but the assignment we did in Scratch has definitely been my favorite.<p>
